### Banked Experience and Ironman EHP

This spreadsheet was created by **cosine** in collaboration with creators of existing EHP sheets

MAKE A COPY DO NOT REQUEST ACCESS

Instructions to see your banked xp are included on the sheet

Whilst this sheet was created with ironmen in mind primarily, it can be used by anyone to see their current banked xp as well as ballpark EHP rates. Note that EHP rates for mains can be significantly higher due to the ability to purchase supplies.

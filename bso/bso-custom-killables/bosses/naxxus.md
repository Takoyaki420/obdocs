## Getting Started

To fight the boss, use `/k` name: `naxxus`

## Boosts

* Void Staff - 10%
* Abyssal Tome - 7.5%

* Ignis Ring (i) - 2.5%
* Spellbound Ring/(i) - 2%/2.5%

## Loot

The unique drops from Naxxus are untradeable (all four items listed below). There is a special mechanic with Naxxus where you won't get a duplicate unique until you have all of them at least once. The chance to roll the unique table is 1/150, the Abyssal Gem and Spellbound ring are more likely to drop first.

* **Dark Crystal:** Used to `/create` the Void Staff (u), a chargeable BiS magic weapon that provides boosts to Cox, Vasa, Sea Kraken, and Naxxus
* **Tattered Tome:** Used to `/create` the Abyssal Tome, a BiS magic tome that boosts Naxxus
* **Spellbound Ring:** BiS magic ring that boosts Naxxus, it can be imbued with a Magus Scroll to further increase the stats
* **Abyssal Gem:** Used to invent the [Abyssal Amulet](../../skills/invention/#inventions)

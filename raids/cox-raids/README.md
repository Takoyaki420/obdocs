# Chambers of Xeric (CoX)

## Getting Started

There are a few things that need to be prefaced before you get started.

To view your current stats and raiding abilities (gear score and death chance), use:

* `/raid cox stats`

To start a Chambers of Xeric raid, use either:

* `/raid cox start`` `**`type:`**` ``solo`
  * Solo CoX can be completed at 0kc, however, you are heavily penalised until 50kc. After 50kc, your solo'ing ability will be increased.
* `/raid cox start`` `**`type:`**` ``mass`
  * Mass Cox requires a minimum of 2 users and has a maximum capacity of 15. Remember that one user will need 55 Farming and 78 Herblore for the mass!

***

## Requirements

* 80+ Attack/Strength/Defence/Ranged/Magic
* 70+ Prayer
* Saradomin Brew(4), Super Restore(4), Stamina Potion(4)
* In a mass, atleast one user needs 55 Farming and 78 Herblore (if solo, you need these too).

It is highly recommended that you have the best possible Melee, Range and Mage gear you can and to equip them in their respective setups. You can still participate with less than the 'best-in-slot' gear but you will receive less points, increase raid time and increase death chance.

View the best in slot and alternate gear setups for CoX [here](cox-gear-setups.md).

## Potion Usage

When you are first starting out you will be using 7x Saradomin Brew(4), 4x Super Restore(4) and 1x Stamina Potion(4) per mass.

These quantities scale based off KC, Challenge Mode and Mass/Solo, excluding the stamina potion. In Solos you will use one extra Stamina Potion(4).

## Finding a Raid Team

In the [support discord server](http://invite.oldschool.gg/) you will find dedicated channels for Chambers of Xeric.

For chatting, asking for help with your gear score you can talk in [`#raids-general`](https://discord.com/channels/342983479501389826/835879359805653002).

For Challenge Mode chambers, solo or mass, it's recommended that you use [`#raids-mass-cm`](https://discord.com/channels/342983479501389826/835879528513142794).

For regular chambers it's recommended that you use [`#raids-mass-regular`.](https://discord.com/channels/342983479501389826/835879317418278963)

Please keep in mind that these are just recommendations, you are not restricted to these channels in order to participate in raiding, it is only recommended as finding a group would be much easier.  You can raid in your own discord servers if you would like to.

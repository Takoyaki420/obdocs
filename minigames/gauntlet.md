# Gauntlet

The Gauntlet is a solo minigame which has some substantial requirements. When you start at both the normal and corrupted gauntlets, your chance of death within the minigame will be quite high. This can be reduced through minion learning (down to 6%).

To begin a trip, use the following commands:

* `/minigames gauntlet start`
* `/minigames gauntlet start`` `**`corrupted:`**`True`

***

## Requirements

* Level 80 in all combat stats (90 for Corrupted)
* Level 77 Prayer
* Level 70 in the following skills:
  * Smithing
  * Mining
  * Farming
  * Agility
  * Woodcutting
  * Fishing
  * Cooking
  * Herblore
  * Construction
  * Hunter
* 200+ quest points
* _Corrupted Gauntlet also requires at least 50kc in the normal Gauntlet_.

***

## Boosts

* Augury & Rigour prayers both provide a 3% boost.
* Higher KC provides a speed boost (up to 20% at 100kc).

***

## Rewards

The standard rewards from gauntlet can be obtained here such as Crystal shards alongside runes, gems, arrows, and rune/dragon alchables. The unique rewards include:

### Crystal weapon seeds ![](../.gitbook/assets/Crystal\_weapon\_seed.png)

You can create a Crystal bow or Crystal halberd (used at ToB). Both require 78 smithing and crafting.

![](../.gitbook/assets/Crystal\_bow.png)`/create`` `**`item:`**`Crystal bow` - Requires 40 shards

![](../.gitbook/assets/Crystal\_halberd.png) `/create`` `**`item:`**`Crystal halberd` - Requires 40 shards

### Crystal armour seeds ![](../.gitbook/assets/Crystal\_armour\_seed.png)

You can create all 3 pieces of the crystal armour set. Each armour piece requires level 70/72/74 smithing and crafting respectively.

&#x20;![](../.gitbook/assets/Crystal\_helm.png)  `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``Crystal helm` - Requires 150 shards

![](../.gitbook/assets/Crystal\_body.png)`/create`` `**`item:`**` ``Crystal body` - Requires 300 shards

&#x20; ![](../.gitbook/assets/Crystal\_legs.png)   `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``Crystal legs` - Requires 450 shards

### Enhanced crystal weapon seeds ![](../.gitbook/assets/Enhanced\_crystal\_weapon\_seed.png)

You need 82 crafting and smithing to create both the inactive and charged versions of the blade/bow. The charged bow provides boosts to bosses such as Sara, Arma, Zulrah, and CoX. The charged blade is used at ToB. Charged versions can be reverted back to inactive versions and inactive weapons can be reverted back to seeds (costs 250 crystal shards for the latter).

* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Blade of saeldor (inactive)` - Requires 100 shards&#x20;
* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Bow of faerdhinen (inactive)` - Requires 100 shards&#x20;
* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Blade of saeldor (c)` - Requires 1000 shards
* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Bow of faerdhinen (c)` - Requires 2000 shards

**Note:** The _charged_ blade/bow are untradeable, while the _inactive_ versions are tradeable.

## Trading in Crystal Seeds

You may trade in your spare crystal seeds for crystal shards through the `/create` command.

* E.g.  `/create`` `**`item:`**` ``Revert crystal armour seed`

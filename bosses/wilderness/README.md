# Wilderness

With the release of the updated wildy bosses, it is more dangerous than ever to hunt uniques in the wilderness! You are now risking more for more reward! This page details the info regarding mechanics and items unique to the wilderness. For info on boosts and requirements on wildy bosses, please visit the [respective page](../boosts-and-requirements.md#callisto-vetion-venenatis-inc.-singles-versions). This page also differs from [revenants](revenants.md), so please check there for revenant specific info.

## Things To Know Before Starting

{% hint style="info" %}
**The following info is specific to wilderness bosses.** [**Revenants**](revenants.md) **have different death and PKer mechanics. Please read that page for more info.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**Killing Callisto, Vet'ion or Venenatis (and their weaker variants) can risk all your equipped items in your wildy gear setup. Do NOT equip items you're not willing to lose.**</mark>

### Death Chance <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Skull (status) icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">

Your death chance is based on a number of factors. Firstly, you need to encounter a PKer for a death to be possible. There are 3 time periods when doing wildy bosses that will influence the chances of you running into a PKer. The below percentages represent how likely you will encounter a PKer _**for every minute of your trip**_. These time periods are random and change every \~2 hours.

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th></th><th align="center"></th><th align="center"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>PK Peak Times</strong></td><td align="center"><p><strong>Chance of PKer at</strong> </p><p><strong>Callisto, Vet'ion, Venenatis</strong></p></td><td align="center"><p><strong>Chance of PKer at</strong> </p><p><strong>Artio, Calvarion, Spindel</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>Low period</td><td align="center">1.52%</td><td align="center">2.85%</td></tr><tr><td>Medium period</td><td align="center">7.59%</td><td align="center">14.29%</td></tr><tr><td>High period<mark style="color:red;"><strong>*</strong></mark></td><td align="center">18.98%%</td><td align="center">35.71%</td></tr></tbody></table>

<mark style="color:red;">**\***</mark> _<mark style="color:red;">**- You will be asked for confirmation when attempting to send a trip during a high PK period.**</mark>_

If you happen to encounter a PKer, you will then "fight" your opponent. There are a few things that will affect whether you get PKed or survive. There is a 10% base chance of your minion getting PKed, however, the following things will affect this percentage:

* Your gear (specifically, your defensive stats. All 3 combat styles play a part)
* Anti-PK supplies (read [Smite chance](./#smite-chance) below)
* Having 43 Prayer for overheads (higher Prayer levels will NOT grant better percentage)
* Your experience in killing wilderness bosses
* Whether the boss is located in a multi-combat area

### Smite Chance <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Smite.png" alt="" data-size="line">

{% hint style="info" %}
These supplies are different from [revenants](revenants.md). Please check there for more info.
{% endhint %}

These supplies will heavily influence your chances of being smited or not. With supplies, the base chance of being smited when you are PKed is 1/300. However, without them, it's a 1/20 chance. These supplies consist of:

&#x20;![](../../.gitbook/assets/Sara\_brew\(4\).png) Saradomin brew(4) - 1 for every 4 minutes of your trip

&#x20;![](../../.gitbook/assets/Super\_restore\(4\).png) Super restore(4) - 1 for every 8 minutes of your trip

## Voidwaker ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Voidwaker.png)

All 3 pieces can be obtained from their respective bosses and combined to create the voidwaker. Each piece is dropped by the stronger variants at 1/360, or 1/912 from the weaker variants. The voidwaker currently gives no boosts to any bosses.

* `/create`` `**`item:`**`voidwaker`

## Upgraded Rev Weapons ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Skull\_of\_vet'ion.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Claws\_of\_callisto.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Fangs\_of\_venenatis.png)

The upgrades to rev weapons can be obtained and attached to create the stronger variant of each.  The upgraded rev weapons provide a slightly better boost over their regular counterparts. It costs 7000 ether to charge a wildy weapon, which can also be reverted to receive the base weapon and ether back.  Each piece is dropped by the stronger variants at 1/196, or 1/618 from the weaker variants.

* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Accursed sceptre`
* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Ursine chainmace`

# Fight Caves

## Overview

You can challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to receive a fire cape, tokkul, and the TzRek-Jad pet. The number of total attempts you have made will largely determine your [chances of killing Jad](./#survival-chance) when he is reached, while your [equipped range gear](./#best-in-slot-range-gear) and a couple of specific items will provide a [boost](./#boosts) to the overall time it takes to complete.

Tokkul gained from completions can be spent at the [Tokkul shop](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/fight-caves/tokkul-shop).\

## Best in Slot Range Gear

The following gear will provide the highest gear bonus while fighting Jad (maximum of 58%). The bonus is based off your range attack bonus, not ranged strength. Your boost is roughly calculated at 1% for every 5.25 range attack bonus. To equip your best range attack gear, use the following:

* `/gear equip`` `**`gear_setup:`**`Range`` `**`auto:`**`attack_ranged`

## Survival Chance

Your survival chance during the fightcaves is calculated based on your number of attempts and whether or not you have a Saradomin godsword equipped. During Jad, your survival chance can never be more than 95%.

If you have any amount of Inferno KC, your survival chance is automatically at it's highest.

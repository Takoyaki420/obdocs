# Phosani's Nightmare

## Overview

Phosani's Nightmare is a more difficult; solo-only version of The Nightmare of Ashihama. It drops the same items as the normal Nightmare, as well as the [Parasitic egg](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Parasitic\_egg) and the [Slepey tablet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slepey\_tablet).\

## BiS Gear

Your melee gear will provide a boost up to 13.2%. This boost is based on each piece of BiS gear you have equipped, with each piece giving 1.2%. Equipping anything that is not BiS, will not grant the 1.2% boost for that slot. Rada's Blessing 4 is BiS for the ammo slot, all other blessings will not suffice.

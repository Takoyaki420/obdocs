# Phosani's Nightmare

## Overview

Phosani's Nightmare is a more difficult; solo-only version of The Nightmare of Ashihama. It drops the same items as the normal Nightmare, as well as the [Parasitic egg](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Parasitic\_egg) and the [Slepey tablet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slepey\_tablet).\
While unique items are rarer from Phosani's Nightmare than they are from the regular Nightmare, Phosani's Nightmare can be killed significantly faster, capping out at 2kc per trip (4kc if patreon).

To kill Phosani's Nightmare, use `/k`` `**`name:`**` ``Phosani's Nightmare`

## Boosts

Phosani boosts are applied from either your bank or equipped gear.

You must use the tablet for the boost to apply: `/use`` `**`item:`**`Slepey tablet`

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Elder maul.png>) 3% for Elder maul

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Dragon claws.png>) 3% for Dragon claws

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Harmonised nightmare staff.png>)  3% for Harmonised nightmare staff

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Slepey tablet.png>)   15% for Slepey tablet (guaranteed at 100KC at either Phosani's- or regular Nightmare)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Worn equipment.png>)  Up to 13.2% for melee gear (see below)

## BiS Gear

Your melee gear will provide a boost up to 13.2%. This boost is based on each piece of BiS gear you equip, with each piece giving 1.2%. Equipping anything that is not BiS, will not grant the 1.2% boost for that slot. Rada's Blessing 4 is BiS for the ammo slot, all other blessings will not suffice.

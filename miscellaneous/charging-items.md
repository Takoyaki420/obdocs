# Charging Items

There are a number of degradable items that must be charged in order to be used or provide a boost for certain bosses/minigames. The maximum amount of charges on an item is 1,000,000. When charging an item, you can add anywhere between 1-100,000 at a time.&#x20;

All items can be charged using `/minion charge`` `**`item:`** **`amount:`**&#x20;

## Global Boosts

The weapons listed on this page will provide global boosts to all PvM, _provided they are equipped in their respective setup, are sufficiently charged, and you're training that specific combat style ._ These global boosts stack with existing boosts (E.g. Shadow gives 20% boost at Kraken, and a further 6% if equipped in mage, charged, and you're training is set to magic).

* [Abyssal tentacle](charging-items.md#abyssal-tentacle) - 3% global boost
* [Scythe of vitur](charging-items.md#scythe-of-vitur) - 5% global boost
* [Trident of the swamp](charging-items.md#trident-of-the-swamp) - 3% global boost
* [Sanguinesti staff](charging-items.md#sanguinesti-staff) - 5% global boost
* [Tumeken's shadow](charging-items.md#tumekens-shadow) - 6% global boost
